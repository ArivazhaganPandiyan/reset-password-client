# Password Reset Frontend

This document provides an overview of the frontend implementation for a password reset task application using React with Vite.

## Overview

The frontend of the password reset task application serves as the client-side interface for users to interact with the application. It provides user interfaces for authentication, password reset functionality, and user account management.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool that significantly speeds up the development process.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in React applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Provides forms for users to register, log in, and log out securely.
2. **Password Reset Functionality**: Allows users to request a password reset via email and securely reset their passwords.
3. **User Account Management**: Provides interfaces for updating user profiles, changing passwords, and deleting accounts.
4. **Responsive Design**: Built with responsiveness in mind to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
5. **Error Handling**: Implements error handling to provide informative feedback to users in case of errors.
6. **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigation between different pages and components.
7. **State Management**: Utilizes React hooks and context for managing application state.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Configure environment variables if necessary, such as the API endpoint URL.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at the specified localhost URL.

## File Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React components, styles, and other assets.
- `public/`: Contains static assets such as HTML files and images.

## Integration with Backend

1. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible.
2. Update the API endpoint URLs in the frontend code to point to the corresponding endpoints on the backend.
3. Handle authentication tokens securely by storing them in local storage or using HTTP-only cookies.
4. Test the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure that API requests are being sent and received correctly.

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend application:

1. Build the application using `npm run build` or .
2. Deploy the built files to a hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
3. Ensure that the API endpoint URLs are correctly configured for the production environment.
